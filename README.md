# OpenPIV PIVLab von Karman vortex street data

The data is from @Shrediquette and it was generously shared via Google Drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19dANQcWhC6x_KjDnQw8kTqHHD-PXFD8A

Thanks to this set we have now also the image masking (for the cylinder). 

The multi-pass with window deformation is performed with the same parameters of 64, 32, 16, 6 pixels ant 50% overlap, see notebooks in the /OpenPIV
